Website Automation Testing Framework

Automate interacts with browsers at the graphical interface level, just like you, and can do almost anything you can do on a website, like click on links, select from a menu, or type into a text box.
When you build your processes, three types of actions are available:

Browser automation. Includes opening and closing the browser, navigating through pages, and extracting page data.
Interactivity actions. Important for automating elements that are not HTML-based, like a "Save As" dialogue or an Adobe Flash element.
Input actions. Includes keystrokes, mouse movements, clicks, and copy/paste.
